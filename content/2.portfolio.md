# Portfolio

- - -

When I make something worth sharing, this is where I put it. It's far from everything,
but most of the good stuff is here.

In addition to the technologies involved in the projects here, I have a decent amount
of experience with Python and have had some runins with C/C++ and Java.

I've been a full time Linux user for five years. For the first one or two I ran Ubuntu before
switching to Arch with i3wm. I'm comfortable with a terminal and Linux troubleshooting.

For development, I use mostly Neovim or Lunarvim

In case you're wondering, the site you're looking at runs on Nuxt 3 with NetlifyCMS.

# Open-Source Contributions

- - -

I only recently got into open source and am not very experienced, so this list is quite short.
But I'm confident it will grow more quickly in the future!

### rust-spice

[rust-spice](https://docs.rs/rust-spice/latest/spice/) is the idiomatic Rust wrapper around [CSPICE](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif), "an observation geometry system for space science missions" created
by NASA.

My contributions:

* [Add `spkopn`, `spkw09`, `spkcls`](https://github.com/GregoireHENRY/rust-spice/pull/6)\
  I added wrappers and tests for CSPICE functions required to write type 9 SPK segments.
* [Add feat. 'lock': Thread-safe API](https://github.com/GregoireHENRY/rust-spice/pull/10)\
  CSPICE itself is not thread safe, and concurrent calls to even simple functions can lead to UB.
  The PR adds an optional feature that provides an API that guarantees thread-safety using atomics and
  Rust's type system.

### cspice-sys

[cspice-sys](https://docs.rs/cspice-sys/latest/cspice_sys/index.html) is the Rust crate that provides the raw FFI bindings to CSPICE functions.

My contribution:

* [Automatically download CSPICE on build if it is not located](https://github.com/jacob-pro/cspice-rs/pull/7)\
  Name pretty much says it all. Adds an optional feature to download the underlying C library if it's not
  found on the system.
