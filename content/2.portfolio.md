# Portfolio

- - -

When I make something worth sharing, this is where I put it. It's far from everything,
but most of the good stuff is here.

In addition to the technologies involved in the projects here, I have a decent amount
of experience with Python and have had some run-ins with C/C++ and Java. I'm also very comfortable with Linux, as I have been a full-time Linux (and sometimes Mac) user for six years.

# Work Experience

- - -

* Jan 2023 - Jul 2023: **Software Engineering Intern at [Forget Finance](https://forget.finance)**\
  I worked as a full-time intern on both the mobile client (React Native) as well as the back-end (Node, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL, partner APIs) of an investment and long-term financial planning app. I built several mission critical and growth-driving features from the ground up, restructured and refactored large parts of the app and fixed many bugs.

# Open-Source Contributions

- - -

I only recently got into open source and am not very experienced, so this list is quite short.
But I'm confident it will grow more quickly in the future!

### rust-spice

[rust-spice](https://docs.rs/rust-spice/latest/spice/) is the idiomatic Rust wrapper around [CSPICE](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif), "an observation geometry system for space science missions" created
by NASA.

My contributions:

* [Add `spkopn`, `spkw09`, `spkcls`](https://github.com/GregoireHENRY/rust-spice/pull/6)\
  I added wrappers and tests for CSPICE functions required to write type 9 SPK segments.
* [Add feat. 'lock': Thread-safe API](https://github.com/GregoireHENRY/rust-spice/pull/10)\
  CSPICE itself is not thread safe, and concurrent calls to even simple functions can lead to UB.
  The PR adds an optional feature that provides an API that guarantees thread-safety using atomics and
  Rust's type system.

### cspice-sys

[cspice-sys](https://docs.rs/cspice-sys/latest/cspice_sys/index.html) is the Rust crate that provides the raw FFI bindings to CSPICE functions.

My contribution:

* [Automatically download CSPICE on build if it is not located](https://github.com/jacob-pro/cspice-rs/pull/7)\
  Adds an optional feature to download the underlying C library if it's not
  found on the system.
