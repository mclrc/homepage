# Who are you?
---
I am an 18 year old programmer and tech enthusiast from Berlin. I fell in love
with code and computers a few years ago, and have toyed around with a variety of
technologies since, trying to make whatever I feel like making.

:TypingElement{}  I constantly try to learn new things and grow as a developer. Nothing feels
more rewarding to me than getting better at something that intimidated you before.
